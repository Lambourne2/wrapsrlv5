# WrapsRL v5 Project Summary

## Project Overview

The WrapsRL v5 project is designed to generate high-quality 1024×1024 decal textures for Rocket League using StyleGAN2-ADA PyTorch. The project addresses the unique challenges of texture generation for video game assets, particularly the constraints of texture mapping in Rocket League decals.

## Key Features

- **Environment Setup**: Configured for Google Colab A100 GPU with automatic hardware selection and system monitoring
- **Data Processing**: Integrated with Google Drive for data ingestion and TFRecords preparation
- **Model Training**: Implemented StyleGAN2-ADA PyTorch training with optimal parameters (batch size 4, ADA augmentation, FP32 precision)
- **Remote Monitoring**: Integrated with Weights & Biases (wandb.ai) for tracking model performance metrics
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using FID and precision/recall metrics
- **Sample Generation**: Generation of 1024×1024 decal textures with visualization tools

## Pretrained Model Recommendations

After thorough research, we recommend the following pretrained models as kickoff points:

1. **StyleGAN2-ADA-3D-Texture**: Specifically designed for texture generation on 3D surfaces, making it ideal for Rocket League decals
2. **BreCaHAD (512x512)**: Trained on medical imagery with structural constraints similar to texture mapping requirements
3. **FFHQ (1024x1024)**: High-resolution model with complex pattern recognition capabilities
4. **MetFaces (1024x1024)**: Demonstrates effective use of ADA for limited data scenarios

Detailed rationales and implementation notes are provided in the `models/pretrained_models_recommendations.md` file.

## Implementation Details

The main notebook (`wrapsrl_v5.ipynb`) is structured into the following sections:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configuration for Google Colab A100 with Drive mounting and dependency installation
2. **Data Ingestion**: Processing data from the provided Google Drive link and preparing TFRecords
3. **Training**: StyleGAN2-ADA PyTorch training with wandb.ai integration for remote monitoring
4. **Evaluation**: Computing FID and precision/recall metrics to assess model quality
5. **Sample Generation**: Generating and visualizing 1024×1024 decal textures
6. **Reporting**: Generating a comprehensive summary of data statistics, training curves, and metrics

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab and ensure A100 GPU is selected
2. Run the environment setup section to mount Google Drive and install dependencies
3. Process the data from the provided Google Drive link
4. Train the model using the recommended pretrained model as a starting point
5. Evaluate the model and generate samples
6. Monitor progress remotely using wandb.ai

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different pretrained models to find the optimal kickoff point
- Implement additional data augmentation techniques specific to texture generation
- Explore integration with 3D rendering tools for real-time visualization of generated textures
- Develop a custom loss function that better respects texture mapping constraints

## Conclusion

The WrapsRL v5 project provides a comprehensive solution for generating Rocket League decal textures using StyleGAN2-ADA PyTorch. By leveraging pretrained models and adaptive discriminator augmentation, the project addresses the challenges of texture generation for video game assets, particularly the constraints of texture mapping in Rocket League decals.
